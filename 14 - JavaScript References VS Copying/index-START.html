    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const playersTwo = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    playersTwo.push('Seed');

    // now here is the problem!

    console.log( 'players: ', players );

    players.splice(-1,1);

    console.log( 'restored players: ', players );

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const playerSlice = players.slice();

    playerSlice.push('Seed Slice');

    console.log( 'playerSlice: ', playerSlice );

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const playerConcat = [].concat(players);
    playerConcat.push('Seed concat');
    console.log( 'playerConcat: ', playerConcat );
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const playersSpread = [...players];

    playersSpread.push('seed')

    console.log( 'playersSpread: ', playersSpread );

    console.log( 'players: ', players );

    playerFrom = Array.from(players);

    console.log( 'playerFrom: ', playerFrom );

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    personRef = person;

    personRef.age = 88

    console.log( 'person: ', person );

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    personCopy = Object.assign({},person, {age : 80})
    console.log( 'personCopy: ', personCopy );
    console.log( 'person: ', person );

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
